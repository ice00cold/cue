"""Cron delivery: target resolution (origin/home/explicit/bot-chat), live-adapter / relay /
standalone send lanes, and ``_deliver_result``.

Cue: every fire runs IN the profile's one main thread (``cron/main_thread.py``), so delivery is
pure EGRESS — the report is sent to the origin chat (platform + chat_id; never a thread/topic
lane), and no reply-side session is seeded or mirrored: any follow-up lands in the same main
thread the fire appended to.

Split out of ``cron.scheduler``. Import names from this module directly (``cron.scheduler`` only
imports the few it calls itself). Origin-resident helpers and sibling split modules are reached
late-bound (``_sched`` / module refs at the bottom) so monkeypatching the defining module works.
